Hi, we're the <b>`neotenites`</b>.

</br>

He's Dwight. She's Caitlin. We're both web developers who work remotely. He works for a social media app, and she works for an online school.

Their boys are Toby and Rupert. Toby is a manx. Rupert is a cat.

We moved into our 38ft 5th wheel in May 2020 so we could travel the US with our cats and have a comfortable workspace. #VanLife is too small of a space for all of us.
