We decided to stay an extra week in Ohio. My dad’s surgery went well, but they kept him a bit longer at the hospital. So we stayed to help out and smoke a few more doobies.

We needed the extra week to finish preparing for our journey back south. Some roof maintenance and car washing. Last minute trips to goodwill to add lightness and cupboard space. Accidental minimalists.

One last visit to our favorite restaurant in the area, Black dog Tavern. A nice restaurant on a golf course with good beers and juicy burgers and cute wait staff. And the best pumpkin pie cheesecake.

Our first leg out of Ohio was a stop in West Virginia. We’re staying at a harvest host called Appalachian Distillery. The distillery shares a parking lot with a restaurant called Fairplain Yacht Club. They have a burger with pulled pork and a variety of beers. Also in the lot is Jackson County Regional Livestock Market, with dozens of cows in a barn that are constantly mooing. It’s almost midnight and I can hear them over the generator. Getting into the lot was a little awkward. It seems there’s a couple different entrances, and some washout and pot holes. But the actual rv site is partly level but rutted. There’s a couple other harvest host members here as well. They showed up while I was napping. One Grand Design Imagine and a Montana Bighorn.

Tomorrow we head further into the Virginias.
