Christmas came and went.

We enjoyed some much needed time off.

Lucas came to visit.

The 3 of us spent New Years Eve at the RV park. We had a blast.
Some guests brought their own fireworks.

As we entered January, Lucas invited us to stay at his parentâ€™s beach house in South Florida. We picked up our friend Hannah and headed south for the weekend.
We left Orlando pretty late, and had a 2.5 hour drive to the beach house.

The beach at night is always magical.
As we relaxed on the sand the moon rose slowly above the water. We were all completely captivated.

After the moon and stargazing we took the party inside and played games and laughed the night away.

Before we knew it, it was early morning and we had to get some rest.

It was a bitter sweet end to the first week of the new year.
We had to head home to take care of our cats.
It was nice to see our friends again after time apart.

Goodbyes were said and we headed back to the real world.
