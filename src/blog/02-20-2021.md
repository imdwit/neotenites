Talked to a realtor

Toby’s doing better already. 
His appetite has increased tho due to the steroids. 

I think I’m having a harder time mentally switching back from full time rv to living in a house. 

It’s ok to not be full time RVers. 

Our situation’s changed. 

We found a lender and started the pre-qualification process.
Today 22nd. we uploaded all our documents and credit.

Rushed through my taxes to submit them for loan approval. 



On the 25th we hauled ass to Jacksonville at 7am and toured 4 hours.

We put an offer in on the first one we looked at, after touring all of them it stood out the most. And it was the cheapest.

By 8:30pm our realtor called to say our offer was accepted.
Including the washer, dryer and chest freezer.

We got everything to our financing guy and paid the deposit. 

The inspection is scheduled for next week.
