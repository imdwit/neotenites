It was a good week. We missed the peak of the Conjunction, but caught it the next day

Then it was Christmas. It was nice to see family again. It's been several months since we'd seen anyone.
We got some great gifts to make the Momentum more cozy.

We had a few days off and I think we spent most of it sitting on the couch being potatoes. It was very relaxing.

Really looking forward to 2021.
