title: How not to do rv internet
---

Today is Tuesday June, 2020.



In preparing to go full-time I looked at how other RVers did their internet setup. As you can imagine there are hundreds of ways to get connected. Hotspotting straight from your phone, to buying a dedicated mobile hotspot like a jetpack (don’t do that), to turning your RV into a hotspot itself. The options are endless.

*TLDR*:
* We use Visible (Verizon network).
* Bought a Verizon Jetpack 7730l which didn’t work.
* Switched to a netgear aircard attached to a wifiranger router for internet. Works ok.

I settled on switching my phone plan to [Visible] wireless because they have a supposedly ‘unlimited’ plan at the time of writing (June, 2020).
For the last couple weeks I was just hot spotting everything from my phone. My laptop for work. My roku tv. Even my kindle. But having to connect to my phone every time I wanted to watch Netflix or YouTube was annoying.

I read that some people had used a Jetpack and a wifi router. So I thought, “cool I’ll get one of those and pop my Visible sim in. No problem”.

I bought a Jetpack 7730l off amazon ‘refreshed’ for $140. Hoping it would allow me to use my sim and eventually buy a second line for it. I saw that other RVers had used it. I went ahead and bought a MIMO [todo link] antenna to go with it. I didn’t think I’d need the router just yet. I figured a Jetpack would be the easiest and quickest option to get us started. Boy was I wrong.  The Jetpack crashes and restarts every 2 mins. Regardless of whether it’s in WiFi or usb tethered mode. I read that some people got away with using it  wifi off and tethered to a raspberry pi as the router. I wasted an afternoon messing with an extra raspi I had. Trying to turn it into a router. No luck. After hours of frustration I ordered a WifiRanger router [todo] for another $80.

I went with the WifiRanger [todo] because it specifically lists the 7730l[todo] as compatible to tether over usb. Didn’t matter. It still crashed.

At this point I had already requested a return on Amazon, but I want to double check and see if the tethering option would work.
A week later the router is delivered. So I plug the jetpack into the router. Get it configured. Finally I’m connected. Or so I thought. The Mifi Jetpack crashes again and again. Back to square one.

Tomorrow a Netgear aircard \$120[todo] should be delivered.

UPS charged me \$20 to send back the busted hotspot. Hoping the return goes smoothly.

The netgear aircard works flawlessly. The antenna seems to add a couple bars of signal, which is critical being in Wekiva Falls. My phone said I had 2 bars. The aircard is almost full signal.
As I’m writing this I’m watching a YouTube video in 1080p on my roku tv. I’d say it’s a success.
After a successful trial run I ordered another SIM card dedicated to the aircard. No more swapping sims or turning on or off hotspots.

For better or worse we’re all in on Verizon’s network. If we don’t have Verizon, we don’t have internet. We’ll have to make sure Verizon is nice and strong when we’re on the road. I also didn’t need to be the wifiranger. I already had a router from our house. ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯
