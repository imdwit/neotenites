So far the 2nd thousand miles is going better than the first. Packing and unpacking is smoother and faster. The cats seem to be adjusting better.
We learned quickly that we should have left our harvest host early. A long line of cattle trucks rolled in to the market blocking us in. There were hundreds of trucks going in and out. So we got in line to leave. From WV we made it into Virginia. There was a drastic change in weather coming into Virginia from the tunnels. 15 degrees warmer and clear. We avoided tolls which took us down some windy bumpy roads. But eventually we made it to Wythe Raceway. Our next harvest host. This one was a much more comfortable stay. We enjoyed a couple races and a few crashes, but soon just enough rain rolled in to cancel the rest of the nights events. So we took the party inside.
The next day we got up and got our COVID tests and had breakfast at another Harvest host (that was booked, so we went to the raceway instead).
The trucks CEL came on.
After we left Wythe we ran into dense fog getting out of Virginia. The damp cold was following us. But eventually we made it to lower elevations which cleared up the fog.

We were late getting into Jellystone. The sites a little muddy from days of rain. But we have a creek side back in. The WiFi here is spotty. But luckily I held onto our WiFiRanger which can boost the parks WiFi signal. Unfortunately there’s no cell service anywhere near the park. The truck was fixed. Our one neighbor left. So it’s just us in the very back of the park. Most people have left for the season. The sun finally came out. We dried out. Got caught up on work and laundry and chores. They have a nice mini golf course.

We got our test results back and are NEGATIVE for COVID

A wet and muddy morning as we leave JellyStone.
We just happen to dodge storms precipitating hurricane zeta as we left North Carolina. A rather long and uneventful drive to Harvest host winery name here. The site has power but its an extra $20. So we just run the generator since we’re on a budget and in a hurry. One less thing to deal with in the morning, which i regret not getting.

Overall, travel days are getting easier. But every morning of, I have a pit in my stomach. It’s not until we’re on the road that some tension eases. Driving a car for 4 hours is nothing like towing your house. Hitching and unhitching is getting faster.

A 3 hour car ride is a 4 hour travel day. Then another hour setting up. 3 days in a row of 3+ hour trips is rough. We’re doing that twice in one week with a short break in between.

It’s much hotter in South Carolina. It was 81 when we pulled into our HH.

We woke up early to leave South Carolina. Toby’s eye is swollen and yucky. We let the generator run dry over night and woke up with a low battery. So again I have to fill and jump the generator to pick up our landing gear before we can leave.
.
Our Garmin gps doesn’t know where our KOA is. So we go 30 mins the wrong direction.
Zeta is pushing a lot of wind at us. The truck gets shoved around by strong gusts. Probably the most exhausting drive yet. Fighting against the wind.
4 hours later we arrive in Savannah. We work a bit.
Toby has an appointment at the vet.
The vet gives him medicine.

The next day we push on through to arrive back at the Suwannee Music Park.

It feels like coming home.

It looks like theres a mini Hulaween happening, which is funny because we were planning on going this year (pre-covid). There's a bunch of people camped out around the lake. There's multiple dj's.

We're super excited to see our friends tomorrow.
