# March, the beginning of
After a week of patiently waiting for our inspection I drove up and met the realtor at the house. 
The inspection wasn’t great. 
Water pools under the house which could cause a number of issues. 
He said there’s 6in pools. 
The question is
How bad is it?
The other question is
How muchs it gonna cost to fix it?

The inspectors can’t get under the house because the crawl space opening is too small for a person to fit in. I couldn’t even fit which is a no go if I were to buy the house. I need to fit. 

We extended our inspection and repair request deadline until next Tuesday. 5 days from now. In hopes that the water drains and they can look at the house again. 

The garage also needs more work than I was expecting. Needs rewiring and there’s termite damage. 

House buying is not fucking easy. 


Toby had another treatment early in the week. But he’s also developed some sniffles and sneezes. 


Caitlin went to Gainesville to visit her friends. So I took the weekend to clean up and start on a video tour of our tiny home.
