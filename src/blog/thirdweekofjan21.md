The nights are often visited by a creeping cold. As temperatures dip you can feel the chill slide up under the floors.

We watched [RV](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0449089/) starring Robin Williams and made cookies.
RV is hilarious and probably more so if you’ve done any RVing yourself.

I think we’re pretty determined, if neccessary, to turn a bare patch of earth into a home. A sanctuary.

Our toy hauler can do some serious boondocking if we have to.


[Stainless Detail](https://www.instagram.com/stainlessdetailinginc/) came out and washed our RV. It needed a scrub. We haven’t washed it since we bought it 10 months ago. They pressure washed, scrubbed and buffed it for $300.
