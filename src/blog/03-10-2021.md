The house was a bust.  After looking at how much work it’d take to get the house habitable we decided to cancel.

The rest of the inspection went even worse. There was some serious damage to floor joists. We can’t afford to fix up a house for weeks and months.

The whole point is to have a turnkey home so we can come and go as we please.

At least toby's doing better. his sneezing has eased off. 

Though he's still increasingly hungry. He's scavenging for food.


I had a dream a clown demon was under the bed. He reached up through the mattress and held me down. 

Maybe it means something.
