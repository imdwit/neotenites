We got brunch and day drank with Calla. Super nice to catch up. Itâ€™s been so long.

Caitlin took her mom out for a spa day.
I took the opportunity to organize and clean.
Small spaces get cluttered quickly.

I sent some emails looking for property.

Toby went to the vet to get an ultrasoun]. They also did a biopsy to see if he has cancer
