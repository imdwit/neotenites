We got some heartbreaking news.
Toby has small cell lymphoma. He's gonna have to start regular chemo treatment.

We were only booked at Wekiva until 2/14 or whatever
But decided to extend it till we knew what Toby’s diagnosis was.
Since he has to have a lot of medicine and frequent trips to the vet we’re staying until he’s well enough to travel again.
It could take a while.
